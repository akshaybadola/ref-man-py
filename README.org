* ref-man

  Python Module for ~ref-man~ (See https://github.com/akshaybadola/ref-man).

  Network requests and xml parsing can be annoying in emacs, so ref-man uses a
  separate python process for efficient (and sometimes parallel) fetching of
  network requests.

* Features

** HTTP integration with Semantic Scholar API (https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api)
   - Fetch with multiple IDs like arxiv, ACL etc.
   - Local files based cache to avoid redundant requests
   - Fetches all metadata in one go (Will change soon as Semantic Scholar is
     updating its API)

** Experimental (and undocumented) Semantic Scholar Search API
   - Mostly gleaned through analyzing network requests. Helpful for searching
     articles.

** HTTP integration with DBLP and ArXiv
   - Supports multiple parallel requests for batch updates

** Fetch PDF from a given URL
   - Easier to fetch using python than with Emacs's callbacks

** Option for proxying requests
   - Particularly useful for PDFs if you're tunneling to your institution from
     home or some other location and the article you want is with institutional
     (IP based) access only.
